# Immo-Util-Bot
This is an [Discord](https://discord.com) Bot, which is used for syncing Member Roles across two different Servers/Guilds on the Voice- and Chat-platform Discord.
The bot also provides utility features for role assignment, so that the one does not have to give everyone role assignment permissions. This was only designed for a single
server/use case and is currently not need and by that also not deployed
